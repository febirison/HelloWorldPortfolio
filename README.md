# Overview

Hello World example project

As a software engineer building my personal portfolio, I started with a simple but meaningful Hello World application. 
This project verifies my toolchain (Git, VS Code, and Python) and demonstrates professional sharing via GitHub.

This software is a Python console app that prints a personalized greeting celebrating Ghana's Black Star.
